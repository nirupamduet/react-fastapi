# 🏛️ Application Architecture

This document outlines the architectural decisions and structural conventions used in the application.

---

## 🧱 Architectural Overview

The application follows a **modular monolith** design using **Next.js App Router**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and optional **Prisma** for ORM and **NextAuth.js** for authentication. The architecture separates UI, domain logic, configuration, and utilities to maximize maintainability and scalability.

## 🔧 Key Technologies

| Layer            | Stack Components                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend         | Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript        |
| Styling          | Tailwind CSS, PostCSS                          |
| Authentication   | NextAuth.js, JWT                               |
| Database         | Prisma ORM (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite, etc.) |
| Validation       | Zod or Yup                                     |
| State Management | React Hooks, optional Context API              |

## 🔌 Application Layers

### 1. **Routing Layer** (`/app`)

* Public, protected, and admin-only views.
* Uses file-based routing provided by Next.js App Router.
* Includes layouts and route guards.

### 2. **Domain Layer** (`/domain`)

* Contains feature-based modules like `auth`, `user`, `product`.
* Each module encapsulates:

  * UI components
  * Business logic (services)
  * Validation schemas
  * Server actions
  * Type definitions

### 3. **UI Layer** (`/components`)

* Shared UI across the application.
* Design system-based components under `ui/`.

### 4. **Utility Layer** (`/lib`, `/hooks`)

* Utility functions (`auth.ts`, `logger.ts`, `utils.ts`).
* Reusable hooks like `useAuth`, `useDebounce`, etc.

### 5. **Configuration Layer** (`/config`)

* App metadata, authentication settings, and environment config loaders.

### 6. **Data Layer** (`/prisma`)

* Prisma schema for DB modeling.
* Seed scripts for bootstrapping data.

---

## 🛡️ Authentication & Authorization

* Handled via `NextAuth.js` with JWT.
* `getServerSession` from `/lib/auth.ts` is used for server protection.
* Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented using roles (e.g., `admin`, `user`).

---

## ⚙️ Dev & Ops Setup

* **ESLint** and **Prettier** ensure consistent formatting.
* **Environment Variables** validated with Zod in `/config/env.ts`.
* `next.config.ts` defines build behavior and rewrites.

---

## 🧪 Testing (Planned)

* Unit Testing (Jest, React Testing Library)
* End-to-End Testing (Playwright or Cypress)

---

## 🌐 Deployment

* Supports Vercel, Netlify, Docker, or self-hosting.
* Prisma migration and seed can be executed in CI/CD.

---

## 🔁 Future Scalability

* Add more `domain` modules (e.g., `orders`, `inventory`).
* Modularize more utilities.
* Implement background jobs and caching if required.
